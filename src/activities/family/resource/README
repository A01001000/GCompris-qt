All the images are taken from OpenClipart.organd modified according to requirement.

To add any new levels in the activities doesn't require any coding skills, we can just do it by adding the calculated coordinates
to the following database
{  edgeList: [
               [],
               []
            ],
   nodePositions: [
           [],
           [],
           []
   ],
   rationn: [80, 80, 80],
   captions: [ [],
              []
            ],
   nodeleave: [],
   currentstate: [],
   edgeState:[],
   answer: [],
   optionss: []

},
rationn will be always constant, rest can be calculated with the trial and error.
